== Goals
* Show underlying complexity that appears simple
* Demonstrate understanding of problem domain (goes to credibility)
* Engaging to audience

== Major themes from healthcare
* Spending ≠ care
** Move to value-based care
* The "Triple Aim" — improved care experience, improved population health, and reduced costs
** http://catalyst.nejm.org/population-health-ghost-aim/[NEJM reference]
* Drive toward evidence-based practice
* Right information to right people at right time
** "Same" data in multiple formats, depending on specialty (e.g. code for bone fracture vs. x-ray image)
* Data quality issues - missing, inconsistently defined/documented/applied

* Data integrations
** e.g. Air quality https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-air-quality-measurements%40public/map/?disjunctive.measurements_parameter&sort=-measurements_parameter&location=10,37.37507,-122.02103&basemap=mapbox.light[OpenDataSoft AQ]
