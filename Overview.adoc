= Patient Engagement
:imagesdir: images

Healthcare is transforming from a paper based, fee for service system to
a digital value based care delivery system.  This transformation
requires Healthcare organizations to engage their patients in ways that
they have never had to before. Wearables & Mobile applications provide a
data driven way for Providers to engage their patients and proactively
take action based on their Healthcare needs.

The diagram below shows conceptually how information might flow.

This concept is supported by the ideas from this Forbes article:

Patient wearables capture information such as Heart Rate, Respiratory
Rate, Oxygen saturation, Activity levels etc.  An IOT scenario would be
to have an engagement database where this information for your patient
population flows in on a periodic basis.  The application layer would
route data to analytics and machine learning algorithms and get results
back to store in the engagement database for alerting & user experience
purposes.  Different algorithms can be applied based on patient cohorts,
for example, if the patient has a chronic condition, has recently been
discharged from the hospital, etc.  Data from EMR systems can also be
combined so that the system understands what treatments the patient has
received, when and when they may be due for a follow up.  The business
rules of the application can notify caregivers within care management
teams when specific events occur, whether is it a level that has trended
out of bounds, or a time based even where the patient needs to notified
to schedule a follow up visit.^link:#cmnt1[[a]]^

The idea behind this type of system is to create “stickiness” for the
patient by proactively managing their care, rather than responding to
issues.  In order to properly manage health for a population, the
provider needs to ensure that the patients participate in their
programs, take action on follow up items, and work with providers in
their network.  If the patient goes out of network, then the provider
may have a gap in visibility into that patient’s care, and may not be
able to follow up proactively.

Why is Couchbase the best Database for Patient Engagement?

* Couchbase is being used in leading IOT offerings today from GE and
Verizon.  Creating an IOT application to monitor patient wearables, and
collect information from other devices is an ideal use case for
Couchbase.
* Couchbase has the full stack that allows data to be synchronized
automatically with mobile devices.  Patients & Caregivers can update
information on their mobile devices, even if connectivity is
lost.^link:#cmnt2[[b]]^
* Couchbase has the Synchronization engine to route data appropriately
throughout the network.  Based on rules returned from machine learning
engines, combined with EMR data and wearable data, Couchbase can route
data to the appropriate Patient device, Caregiver device and other
applications.
* Couchbase has connectors to allow for integration with external
systems required to enhance the interaction data with transactional and
analytical data.

Demo Functionality

The functionality of the demo would be broken up into 3 parts.

1.  Patient Notification

1.  Mobile application for patient (mocked up UI of some sort)
2.  Notify all patients that need to schedule a follow up appointment
within the next week

1.  Business rule is based on their last appointment & their
diagnosis^link:#cmnt3[[c]]^
2.  Manually show this with a N1QL update, show the “sexiness” of how a
single N1QL update can flow through the entire network.

1.  Backend

1.  Show the rules that are configured in Sync Gateway to deliver data
to patients and to caregivers. Channels, etc, etc
2.  Show CB Server backend cluster, with high level walk through of some
monitoring statistics
3.  Discuss key message of the platform:

1.  Agility & Flexibility
2.  Performance at Scale
3.  Ease of Management

1.  Caregiver Report w/change to underlying data model (demonstrate
agility & flexibility)

1.  Show the caregiver report with a list of patients and their vital
signs^link:#cmnt4[[d]]^ such as Activity Level, Respiratory Rate &
Oxygen saturation.  Heart Rate is not included.
2.  Modify app to capture Heart Rate to include in report.  Discuss how
since Couchbase is JSON based, the underlying data model can be easily
modified.  This is not a technical message, but a business message.  One
of the most frustrating issues for business users is the time that it
takes for their IT organizations to add new tables, etc, to the
database.  By the time the changes are done, the requirements have
changed.  This should appeal to the user to give them confidence that
with Couchbase, the database can quickly evolve to meet business needs.
3.  Make the change and modify the report.
4.  ?? Can we show the change on the device also
5.  Showcase what happens under the hood to make this happen.  We are
handling the complexity and we make it look simple for the end users.
6.  Highlight security, show patient appearing in another caregiver
report
7.  This would be a good point to include Dipti’s idea of an “Alert:
Ravi’s heart rate is high.” The scenario would be that we have been
monitoring Ravi the whole time, and by adding Heart Rate to the report
now, we instantly get an alert.  Why is he stressed should be scripted
out, etc.

Demo Script

Actors:

Doctor

Patient 1

Patient 2

Narrator/Background Speaker

Narrative:

1.  [Patient 1] - I’ve just got this kool new gadget that tracks all my
vital statistics and sends them to my doctor.
2.  [Patient 1] - Let me see if it even works.

1.  They bring their phone next to the NFC chip.
2.  The phone captures the temperature reading.
3.  The temperature shows on the device.

1.  [Patient 1] - Let me see if really works. Would the doctor even know
that i am sick? What would my doctor do if I was really sick? Let’s see
what happens when i accidentally (wink wink ...) drop this temperature
sensor in hot water.

1.  They drop the NFC chip in hot water.
2.  They bring their phone next to the NFC chip.
3.  The phone captures the temperature reading and it is really high.
4.  The temperature shows on the device.

1.  [Patient 1] - Oohh …. I have really high fever. I almost feel like I
have fever.

1.  Feel their head
2.  [Patient 1] - my head does feel a little warm. Am I really getting
sick?

1.  The scene shifts to the doctor who is sitting in their office
sipping coffee.

1.  Their desktop application displays an alert.
2.  [Doctor] - Oh my God. “Patient 1” is really sick - the temperature
reading is really high. I hope he is all right. They should rest and
immediately take some tylenol.

1.  [Doctor] - Let me send him a message and tell him that.

1.  The doctor navigates to “patient 1” by clicking on the alert in the
web application.
2.  The doctor sends a message to “patient 1”.

1.  “Doctor” types the message to the patient - “Your temperature is
really high. You should rest and immediately take some tylenol.”

1.  The scene shifts to “patient 1” who receives an alert in the
application letting them know “they have a new message from their
doctor”.
2.  [Patient 1] - “Doctor” sent me a new message. I wonder why he is
sending me a message at this hour.
3.  [Patient 1] - OMG! “Doctor” thinks that i have high fever. I’ll let
him know that i accidentally dropped the sensor in hot water. I doing
fine but thanks for checking in.

1.  They are a little embarrassed that this new technology really allows
the doctor to keep track of their health.

1.  Scene shifts to the doctor who has just read the message from
“patient 1”.
2.  [Doctor] - That was a false alarm. It would be really useful to
track pulse rate, blood pressure and oxygen level in addition to
temperature.
3.  [Doctor] - I wonder how long it will take IT to add these to the
application. I really hope they can do it in < 6 months.
4.  [Narrator] - IT gets a request that they need to support additional
user health data.
5.  [Narrator] - IT uses Couchbase Data platform that allows them to
make schema changes on the fly.
6.  [IT Guy] - I can add these additional health tracking data in no
time. I can really impress the whole team with how fast i can do this.
Would it be too cocky if i said that i already knew they were going to
ask for this? Hmm … let me be humble …
7.  [IT Guy] - Added new fields to the JSON document. (Big high fives
with someone?)
8.  [IT Guy] - Walks to doctor and let’s them know that their request
for more health data is done. If you choose the Couchbase data platform,
you can impress even the hard to please doctor. Punchline - TBD

1.  Patient 1 updates their app and sees the new health tracking data.

1.  [Patient 1] - Wow! They are tracking a lot more information about me
now. I feel like i am in good hands.

1.  Doctor checks the “health record” application and everything after
the addition of the new fields is tracking that data.

1.  [Doctor] - this is really great! Punchline about the IT department -
TBD
2.  [Doctor] - Let me send the results of the blood test to patient 2.

1.  Scene shifts to “patient 2” who receives a message on their phone
that their blood test report is now available.
2.  Patient 2 is boarding a flight and puts their phone in airplane
mode.
3.  [Patient 2] - I wonder if i can still access my blood test report.
Holy crap. This works even when i am flying across the atlantic with no
internet connectivity. “ABC Medical Group” is one of the most tech savvy
out there. ^link:#cmnt5[[e]]^

1.  Patient 2 sends a message to the doctor saying thank you for sending
the results.

1.  [Patient 2] - Flight has landed. Let me get out of airplane mode
2.  Scene shifts to the doctor. He receives an alert and clicks on it.
3.  [Doctor] - Patient 2 got the results and is mighty relieved
everything is alright.

Customer Participation

At the end of the demo, have Everyday Health or BD come on stage to
discuss how they are engaging their Patients using the Couchbase
Engagement Database.  Everyday Health has app that is very similar to
the scenario above.  BD has an application that is in line with the
fictitious example above.  They monitor data from insulin devices, apply
business rules and take action based on those rules.^link:#cmnt6[[f]]^
